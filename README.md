**Fresh Type** is a typing website that offers a unique and engaging typing experience with a minimalistic design.

## Introduction

Fresh Type was developed to test and enhance my frontend development skills using React, and to experiment with the OpenAI API. This project was inspired by my experiences in 2021 with various typing test websites, which either had static, unchanging passages that I would quickly memorize or random word combinations that are uninteresting to type. I wanted to type more interesting passages and avoid repetition. Fresh Type aims to provide just this.
