This project was made build on my frontend development skills in React and mess with the openAI API. I also wanted to build this because a few years ago (around 2021) I tried a lot of typing test websites and none of them was satisfying to me. Most sites would either have interesting passages but never update it so I would quickly memorize them, or they would have random combination of words. 
I wanted to type full passages about interesting topics but also avoid typing the same things over and over.
